## Hi! I am Shanur

I recently embraced my long time passion in software development. I have a wealth of experience working as a Project Manager and wish to one day combine my experience as a Project Manager and Developer in the future. I love the knowledge and insight I gain as I gain more experience as a developer. My Project Management experience allowed me to recognise how to apply my development skills and also view products from both User and Developer prespective. I like to learn the foundations first and build upon it instead of taking the quick and easy way out. I am comfortable with HTML. CSS, JavaScript, React.js, MySQL and Python.
